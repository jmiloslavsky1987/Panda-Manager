# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** Every PS delivery intelligence — 15 AI skills, all project context, all action tracking — lives in one place, runs automatically, and is always current.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Data Foundation

## Current Status

**Phase:** 1 — Data Foundation (in progress)
**Current Plan:** 5 of 6
**Last action:** Completed 01-04 — YAML export utility (lib/yaml-export.ts) + DataService (bigpanda-app/lib/data-service.ts)
**Next action:** Execute Plan 01-05 — Migration script
**Stopped at:** Completed 01-04-PLAN.md (YAML export utility + DataService)

## Phase Progress

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Data Foundation | In progress (4/6 plans complete) |
| 2. App Shell + Read Surface | Not started |
| 3. Write Surface + Plan Builder | Not started |
| 4. Job Infrastructure | Not started |
| 5. Skill Engine | Not started |
| 6. MCP Integrations | Not started |
| 7. File Generation + Remaining Skills | Not started |
| 8. Cross-Project Features + Polish | Not started |

## Active Work

**Plan 01-05** — Migration script (reads YAML context docs + PA3_Action_Tracker.xlsx from /Documents/PM Application/)

## Decisions

- **[2026-03-19] 01-01:** Used Node.js built-in test runner (node:test) — no Jest/Vitest needed
- **[2026-03-19] 01-01:** DATABASE_URL defaults to postgres://localhost:5432/bigpanda_test in tests (prevents crash when env var unset)
- **[2026-03-19] 01-01:** postgres and tsx installed at project root (not inside server/ or client/)
- [Phase 01-03]: Settings library at both project root (test access) and bigpanda-app/lib/ (server-only for Next.js)
- [Phase 01-03]: readSettings/writeSettings accept optional settingsPath arg for test isolation without mocking fs
- **[2026-03-19] 01-02:** db/ lives in bigpanda-app/db/ (plan-spec); pool.test.ts updated to import from '../bigpanda-app/db/'
- **[2026-03-19] 01-02:** server-only import omitted from db/index.ts — next/compiled version throws unconditionally in Node.js test context
- **[2026-03-19] 01-02:** FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY added to all 8 RLS tables — ensures tests pass regardless of DB user superuser status
- **[2026-03-19] 01-02:** PostgreSQL not installed on this machine — migration requires user to install PostgreSQL and run drizzle-kit migrate
- [Phase 01-04]: server-only omitted from lib/yaml-export.ts for test runner compat (same pattern as db/index.ts)
- [Phase 01-04]: buildYamlDocument takes two args (project, sections) — Wave 0 stub updated during TDD RED
- [Phase 01-04]: outputs.test.ts uses NODE_PATH=./bigpanda-app/node_modules workaround for js-yaml access

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01-data-foundation | 01 | 4min | 2/2 | 9 |
| 01-data-foundation | 02 | 20min | 2/2 | 14 |
| 01-data-foundation | 03 | 8min | 1/1 | 3 |
| 01-data-foundation | 04 | 15min | 2/2 | 4 |

## Key Context for Next Session

- **Working directory:** `/Users/jmiloslavsky/Documents/Project Assistant Code`
- **Wave 0 complete:** All 8 test stubs exist in tests/ — verify commands valid for Plans 01-02 through 01-06
- **Research flags:** Phases 4, 5, 6, 7 require research spikes before planning (see ROADMAP.md)
- **Critical pitfall:** BullMQ worker must be a dedicated process — never in-process cron
- **Critical pitfall:** SkillOrchestrator must be separated from Route Handlers before Phase 5
- **Cowork compatibility:** js-yaml settings `sortKeys: false, lineWidth: -1, JSON_SCHEMA` — non-negotiable
- **Version ground-truth:** React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind 4, pptxgenjs v4, Anthropic SDK 0.78.x — read from existing package.json files
- **DB setup required:** PostgreSQL not installed — user must install PostgreSQL, create bigpanda_test + bigpanda_app DBs, and run `cd bigpanda-app && DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/bigpanda_test npx drizzle-kit migrate`
- **git add blocked:** bigpanda-app/db/ exists on disk but bash sandbox blocked staging; user should `git add bigpanda-app/db/`
- **Test runner:** Use `NODE_PATH=./bigpanda-app/node_modules npx tsx --test tests/yaml-roundtrip.test.ts` (js-yaml in bigpanda-app/node_modules only; npm install fails due to invalid esbuild semver in package-lock.json)
- **yaml-export ready:** lib/yaml-export.ts + bigpanda-app/lib/data-service.ts both committed and tested
- **Pre-existing TS errors:** bigpanda-app/lib/settings.ts and app/api/settings/route.ts have 2 TS errors from 01-03 (see deferred-items.md)
